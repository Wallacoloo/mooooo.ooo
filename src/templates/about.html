<h1>About this Website</h1>
<p>
MOOOOO.ooo is the place where I post ideas or solutions to problems that I was unable to previously find information for online.
The focus of these topics is primarily computing and engineering.

The website is hosted with the aid of the InterPlanetary File System (<a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a>) - a peer-to-peer technology that aims to decentralize the web while simultaneously improving its archivability and speed.
The source code for the website can be found <a href="https://github.com/Wallacoloo/mooooo.ooo">here</a>.
