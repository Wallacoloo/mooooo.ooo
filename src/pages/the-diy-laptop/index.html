{# Plan:
Background: Why a DIY laptop.

{{ heading("Background") }}

<p>
Back in August, I decided to ditch my horribly dated Toshiba Satellite and set myself up with a new computer.
Based on my experience buying a low-end laptop the previous time and then my inability to meaningfully upgrade its RAM or hard disk,
I wanted something that was atleast mid-range for today, and upgradeable in the future.
Turns out, it's very difficult to find a mid-range laptop that doesn't have a ridiculous price markup.
And barebones, easily upgradeable laptops are prohibitively expensive.
</p>

<p>
So I looked into other options - especially in the DIY area.
There's a fair amount of talk about "DIY laptops", but everyone interprets the phrase differently and there are very few actual results beyond somebody's ridiculously over-the-top plans or really weak builds based on TV sticks.
</p>

<p>
Enter Intel's NUC (I spent a good 2 months with research before deciding upon the NUC, but I'm skipping all the ideas I ditched for the sake of brevity).
</p>

<p>
The intel NUC is an unusually-powerful mini-PC. There's a whole class of PCs in this form factor, but the majority of them pack whimpy Atom processors and have soldered RAM or few connectivity options.
</p>

<p>
This particular model packs a 5th-generation i5-5250U dual-core (plus hyperthreading) processor with intel HD 6000 graphics packing 768 GFLOPS {{ cite(url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_HD_and_Iris_Graphics#Broadwell") }} all at a 15 W TDP. It also accepts 2x8GB LPDDR3 DIMMs and has one M.2 slot for your choice of SSD. The price tag is around $350. Couple this with a display, battery, keyboard and touchpad, and you've got a decent laptop.
</p>

<p>
And... enter Motorola's failed Lapdock project:
</p>

{{ show_image(get_image("amazon-lapdock.jpg"), caption="Source: " + offsite_link("https://www.amazon.com/AT-Laptop-Dock-Motorola-ATRIX/dp/B004M17D62", "Amazon product page") + ".") }}

<p>
The Lapdock provides all the components I listed previously, plus a pair of (weak) speakers and exposes all those peripherals over a single USB connection + one HDMI connection. It was originally designed to be paired with a specific Motorola phone model, but that's irrelevant - it can be connected to <em>anything</em>.
</p>

{{ heading("Let's Get Hacking") }}

<p>
Naturally, these two products should pair with each other.
The next thing to determine is whether the Lapdock could source enough power for the NUC or if I'd need an additional battery (the Lapdock is just designed to charge a phone and host a pair of USB devices - it might not be spec'd high enough for the NUC system).
So I cracked open the Lapdock and found my way to the battery circuitry.
</p>

<p>
This part was new to me - batteries are an intimidating thing when it comes to safety.
I figured Motorola, being a fairly reputable company, had the proper protections very close to the cells, if not actually integrated into the batteries, so I just attached clips right near the base of the bus that transmits power from the battery circuitboard to the main circuit board, made a mental note of where my (electrical-)fire extinguisher was, attached an "adjustable load", and measured the voltage across the load as I adjusted it.
</p>

{{ show_image(page.images["lapdock-power-load.jpg"], caption="A low-precision \"adjustable load\" for the hapless engineer.") }}

<p>
I approximated the maximum power supply by adjusting the load between 12 ohms and 3 ohms, measuring the voltage across the load after 30 seconds and using Ohm's {{ inline_code("P=V^2/R") }} relationship.
I stopped at 35 W as a precaution (it's enough for my application), but presumably one can extrapolate further based on these results plotted below.
</p>

{{ show_image(get_image("voltage-vs-power.png"), caption="Voltage vs. Power measured at full-charge with ambient temperature around 25 C.") }}

<p>
I don't know much about battery chemistry, but if we model the battery and its control circuitry as a {{ offsite_link("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9venin's_theorem", "Thevenin circuit") }},  we can infer that over 4 W are dissipated in the surrounding circuitry when the load reaches 35 W (i.e. 89% efficiency).
I don't know the implications of this -- the lapdock's shell should serve as a giant heat-sink if necessary, and this heat is already spread over much more area than a single IC -- but I still wouldn't push it.
Fortunately, power loss appears to have a <em>quadratic</em> relationship with the load (which is intuitive); a 20 W load causes only about 1.1 W in power loss, and that's our target operating range.
</p>

<p>
Now, the NUC advertises an input voltage anywhere between 12 V and 19 V. I figure that the 12 V would be aimed at robotics - many of which are powered by batteries with a <em>nominal</em> voltage of 12 V.
Hence, it wouldn't be unexpected if it's really designed for ~11.5 V, as the battery drains or heats up, and it's good practice for manufacturers to add error margins to this number on top of that.
</p>

<p>
So in the spirit of error margins, or rather, <em>against</em> that spirit, I figured I'd at least <em>try</em> connecting the lapdock's power supply directly to the NUC before trying to find where to hack on a voltage regulator.
</p>

{{ show_image(get_image("battery-to-nuc-3.jpg"), caption="Tidy things up & connect HDMI + USB...") }}
{{ show_image(get_image("battery-to-nuc-4.jpg")) }}

<p>
Lo and behold, it works!*
<br>
<sub>*<i>Well, on a full charge, anyway. The NUC has a tendency to shut off around the 40% battery level in warmer weather.</i></sub>
</p>

{{ heading("A Better Mount") }}

<p>
This doesn't exactly fit into the "laptop" category in the form shown above, so I needed a way to fix that.
The NUC actually has some hardware on the underside that's designed to interface with a
{{ offsite_link("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Display_Mounting_Interface", "VESA mount") }}.
I considered gluing a VESA mount onto the Lapdock, but I felt that might become too restrictive in the future.
</p>

<p>
Instead, I decided to create a set of "J"-shaped brackets that would fit around the lip of the lid and hold via a combination of gravity (when the lid is opened) and friction (when the lid is closed).
</p>

{{ show_image(get_image("mounting-bracket-openscad.png"), caption="A CAD model of the bracket, made with " + offsite_link("http://www.openscad.org/", "OpenSCAD") + ".") }}

<p>
These brackets have holes at the end that are larger than the screws holding the NUC's bottom on, but smaller than the screws' heads. This should allow them to be securely fastened onto the bottom of the NUC.
</p>

<p>
Since I have access to a 3d printer, I figured it would make sense to use one to fabricate a prototype.
</p>

{{ show_image(get_image("mounting-bracket-on-bed.jpg")) }}

<p>
These brackets attach to the NUC like so:
</p>

{{ show_image(get_image("bracket-attach-nuc-1.jpg")) }}
{{ show_image(get_image("bracket-attach-nuc-2.jpg")) }}
{{ show_image(get_image("bracket-attach-nuc-3.jpg")) }}
{{ show_image(get_image("bracket-attach-nuc-4.jpg"),
caption="Notice how there are two bracket sizes; the longer brackets connect to the top of the lapdock, whereas the shorter one clamps to the side.") }}

<p>
Then the whole thing fits snugly around the lapdock, and it still closes comfortably.
</p>

{{ show_image(get_image("bracket-attach-lapdock.jpg")) }}

{# TODO: show an image of the lapdock closed w/ the brackets #}

{{ heading("Improving the Power Delivery") }}

<p>
With that complete, it's time to refine the power routing.
The prototype had a pair of wires jammed into empty slots (i.e. friction-fit) of a connector on the battery circuitboard that just happened to be connected to power, and then a dangling chord sticking out the back of the lapdock, even when the NUC was detached.
</p>

<p>
An improvement would be to solder a permanent connection inside the lapdock and bring this out to a socket near the USB/HDMI connectors, and then make the final connection to the NUC via a short extension cable.
</p>

<p>
So I re-opened the lapdock and soldered wires onto the <em>main</em> board this time, right near the point where its delivered over the ribbon cable.
</p>

{{ show_image(get_image("power-routing-solder.jpg"), caption="The two lanes on each edge of the connector carry power (i.e. 2+ and 2-). <b>Be sure to unplug the ribbon cable before doing this so there's no possibility of shorting the battery</b>.") }}

{# TODO: show the other end of the power cable here (requires taking another photo) #}

Now we need to bring this out the back of the lapdock.
This area of the lapdock can be difficult to access.
Most of the disassembly is straightforward, but note that there is a screw on either end of the rotating plastic piece that holds the connectors hidden under a cap that must be removed:

{{ show_image(get_image("power-routing-access-1.jpg"), caption="The small plastic cover is glued on top of each screw and must be pried off.") }}

Also, <em>some</em> Lapdock versions have an extra piece of plastic that serves to hide a seam. It can be removed just by pulling with force:

{{ show_image(get_image("power-routing-access-2.jpg")) }}

Finally, the connector panel should look like this when it's opened:

{{ show_image(get_image("power-routing-candidate-location.jpg")) }}

For my version, there was a large enough gap inside the housing that we could fit another connector. So, start drilling:

{{ show_image(get_image("power-routing-drilling.jpg"), caption="A 7/32\" bit seemed to be the perfect fit." ) }}

Then just insert the other end of the connector:

{{ show_image(get_image("power-routing-insertion.jpg")) }}

And finally, route the wires out the gap in the side of the housing and close it up like so:

{{ show_image(get_image("power-routing-closed-housing.jpg")) }}
