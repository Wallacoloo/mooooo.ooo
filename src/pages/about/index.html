{{ heading("About this Website") }}
<p>
MOOOOO.ooo is the place where I post ideas or solutions to problems that I was unable to previously find information for online.
The focus of these topics is primarily computing and engineering.
</p>

<p>
The website is hosted with the aid of the InterPlanetary File System (<a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a>) - a peer-to-peer technology that aims to decentralize the web while simultaneously making it faster, safer and more permanent.

In the event that the domain name expires or becomes inaccessible, the website may be loaded through the IPFS portal by its IPFS name: <a href="https://ipfs.io/ipns/{{ ipfs.ipns_id }}">{{ ipfs.ipns_id }}</a>.

The source code for the website can be found <a href="https://github.com/Wallacoloo/mooooo.ooo">here</a>.
