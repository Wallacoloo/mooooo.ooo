% The Jackson Pad: DIY Vibration Damping for Drumsets

![](jackson-pad-assembled-profile.jpg)

After moving into an apartment, I wanted to make sure my drumming wouldn't bother
neighbors, so I bought an electronic set and ditched the acoustic one. Not so long
after, I received my first ever noise complaint!

It turns out that even with an electronic set, a lot of energy is transmitted into
the floor on which it's sitting. Vibrations carry from the drum when struck, into
the stand, and into the floor. But moreover, the action of a foot triggering
a pedal mirrors the same action a person would make when stomping, so of course
that's going to annoy a downstairs neighbor.

# Options to decrease vibrations

The most straightforward way to decrease the vibrations that are transmitted
through the floor is to decrease the energy associated with each drum hit.
For example, use [beaterless pedals](https://www.amazon.com/Yamaha-KU100-Beaterless-Silent-Pedal/dp/B00FI2PE1U).
If there's no beater imparting energy into kick drums that's sitting directly
on the floor, that's obviously going to result in less energy transmitted into
the floor.
Similarly, the high hat for my electronic set behaves similarly to an acoustic hat:
pedal action physically moves the top hat up or down, and when I slam the high-hat
closed, that's a sudden transfer of momentum from the top hat, into the high-hat
stand, and into the floor.
Beaterless pedals solve both these issues.

But, maybe you've already sacrificed enough in the move from acoustic to electronic,
and beaterless pedals don't do much to stop vibrations from the stomping motion
or from hitting the other drums.

There are off-the-shelf products aimed specifically to solve this issue,
so-called [drum noise elimination podiums](https://www.thomann.de/gb/thomann_drum_noise_elimination_podium.htm).

Or you can place the set atop a riser.

I have to say I was very tempted by that Thomann podium, but it was priced a bit aggressively.

Cheaper options include placing the set on a big rubber or foam pad, similar
to what you might put under a washing machine or an exercise bike ("anti vibration mats").

But the drummer forums really pushed me towards DIY solutions, with not a lot of
success stories from using anti-vibration mats. Maybe that's just a bias the people
on these forums have, and anti-vibration mats work equally well, but I was
intrigued and I researched more.

# DIY solutions

The most infamous DIY approach within these drum communities is the *tennis ball riser*:
Sandwich tennis balls between two large panels (or a panel and the floor), put the drumset
on top, and you're done. It's a simple suspension system, and actually resembles that
commercial Thomann podium quite a bit.

A more thoroughly engineered solution I came across was *The Jackson Pad*. The
creator (Brian Jackson) provided detailed build instructions, some convincing
noise measurements, a believable theory of operation, and I couldn't find anyone
who tried this *without* success.

# The Jackson Pad

Initially proposed [over on vdrums.com](https://www.vdrums.com/forum/advanced/diy/1095500-new-design-impact-isolating-platform-plans-and-guide),
I've mirrored the original [design document](Jackson Pad - Design Drawings - 2-10-2015.pdf)
and [build instructions](The Jackson Pad - R1 - Illustrated Builders Guide.doc).

The first idea is that the drumset should sit atop a platform that has a lot of mass.
Because of the high mass, the momentum you impart onto it when stomping your feet
causes less physical displacement than a platform with low mass.
The second idea is to set this new platform atop four air-filled inner tubes.
The displacement of the platform will compress the air within the tubes, simultaneously
transforming mechanical energy into heat energy (compressing a gas causes it to heat),
and redirecting some of the motion outward instead of downward.
My understanding in this area is unfortunately weak, but of all the solutions I
could find, this one had the most reasonable theory of operation to me.
